The goal of Dictadroid is to provide an esay to use, responsive and flexible interface to explore and syncronize audio recordings (of courses for example) from any recording source with pictures that were taken during the recording with an android device.

This project aims to help anyone that can not take notes in the conventional handwritten way (like people with certain disabilities)
